    and scale to petabytes for $1,000 per terabyte per year, less than a tenth the
    cost of traditional solutions. Customers typically see 3x compression, reducing
    their costs to $333 per uncompressed terabyte per year.

- name: AWS Snowball
  slug: aws-snowball
  api_evangelist_rank: '10'
  details: Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure appliances
    totransfer large amounts of datainto and out of theAWS cloud. Using Snowball addresses
    common challenges with large-scale data transfers including high network costs,
    long transfer times, and security concerns. Transferring data with Snowball is
    simple, fast, secure, and can be as little as one-fifth the cost of high-speed
    Internet.With Snowball, you don’t need to write any code or purchase any hardware
    to transfer your data. Simply create a job in the AWS Management Console and a
    Snowball appliance will be automatically shipped to you*. Once it arrives, attach
    the appliance to your local network, download and run the Snowball client to establish
    a connection, and then use the client to select the file directories that you
    want to transfer to the appliance. The client will then encrypt and transfer the
    files to the appliance at high speed. Once the transfer is complete and the appliance
    is ready to be returned, the E Ink shipping label will automatically update and
    you can track the job status viaAmazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), text
    messages, or directly in the Console.Snowball uses multiple layers of security
    designed to protect your data including tamper-resistant enclosures, 256-bit encryption,
    and an industry-standard Trusted Platform Module (TPM) designed to ensure both
    security and full chain-of-custody of your data. Once the data transfer job has
    been processed and verified, AWS performs a software erasure of the Snowball appliance.

  details: The Data Lake analytics service is a new distributed analytics service
    built on Apache YARN that dynamically scales so you can focus on your business
    goals, not on distributed infrastructure. Instead of deploying, configuring and
    tuning hardware, you write queries to transform your data and extract valuable
    insights. The analytics service can handle jobs of any scale instantly by simply
    setting the dial for how much power you need. You only pay for your job when it
    is running making it cost-effective. The analytics service supports Azure Active
    Directory letting you simply manage access and roles, integrated with your on-premises
    identity system. It also includes U-SQL, a language that unifies the benefits
    of SQL with the expressive power of user code. U-SQL’s scalable distributed runtime
    enables you to efficiently analyze data in the store and across SQL Servers in
    Azure, Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.

  details: Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure appliances
    totransfer large amounts of datainto and out of theAWS cloud. Using Snowball addresses
    common challenges with large-scale data transfers including high network costs,
    long transfer times, and security concerns. Transferring data with Snowball is
    simple, fast, secure, and can be as little as one-fifth the cost of high-speed
    Internet.With Snowball, you don’t need to write any code or purchase any hardware
    to transfer your data. Simply create a job in the AWS Management Console and a
    Snowball appliance will be automatically shipped to you*. Once it arrives, attach
    the appliance to your local network, download and run the Snowball client to establish
    a connection, and then use the client to select the file directories that you
    want to transfer to the appliance. The client will then encrypt and transfer the
    files to the appliance at high speed. Once the transfer is complete and the appliance
    is ready to be returned, the E Ink shipping label will automatically update and
    you can track the job status viaAmazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), text
    messages, or directly in the Console.Snowball uses multiple layers of security
    designed to protect your data including tamper-resistant enclosures, 256-bit encryption,
    and an industry-standard Trusted Platform Module (TPM) designed to ensure both
    security and full chain-of-custody of your data. Once the data transfer job has
    been processed and verified, AWS performs a software erasure of the Snowball appliance.

    also known as AWS Microsoft AD, enables your directory-aware workloads and AWS
    resources to use managed Active Directory in the AWS Cloud. The Microsoft AD service
    is built on actual Microsoft Active Directory and does not require you to synchronize
    or replicate data from your existing Active Directory to the cloud. You can use
    standard Active Directory administration tools and take advantage of built-in
    Active Directory features such as Group Policy, trusts, and single sign-on. With
    Microsoft AD, you can easily joinAmazon EC2andAmazon RDS for SQL Serverinstances
    to a domain, and useAWS Enterprise IT applicationssuch asAmazon WorkSpaceswith
    Active Directory users and groups.

    that computers use to connect to each other. Amazon Route 53 is fully compliant
    with IPv6 as well.Amazon Route 53 effectively connects user requests to infrastructure
    running in AWS – such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers,
    or Amazon S3 buckets – and can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside
    of AWS. You can use Amazon Route 53 to configure DNS health checks to route traffic
    to healthy endpoints or to independently monitor the health of your application
    and its endpoints. Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow makes it easy for you to manage
    traffic globally through a variety of routing types, including Latency Based Routing,
    Geo DNS, and Weighted Round Robin—all of which can be combined with DNS Failover
    in order to enable a variety of low-latency, fault-tolerant architectures. Using
    Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow’s simple visual editor, you can easily manage how
    your end-users are routed to your application’s endpoints—whether in a single
    AWS region or distributed around the globe. Amazon Route 53 also offers Domain
    Name Registration – you can purchase and manage domain names such as example.com
    and Amazon Route 53 will automatically configure DNS settings for your domains.

    for use with AWS services. SSL/TLS certificates are used to secure network communications
    and establish the identity of websites over the Internet. AWS Certificate Manager
    removes the time-consuming manual process of purchasing, uploading, and renewing
    SSL/TLS certificates. With AWS Certificate Manager, you can quickly request a
    certificate, deploy it on AWS resources such as Elastic Load Balancers or Amazon
    CloudFront distributions, and let AWS Certificate Manager handle certificate renewals.
    SSL/TLS certificates provisioned through AWS Certificate Manager are free. You
    pay only for the AWS resources you create to run your application.

- name: AWS CloudHSM

  api_evangelist_rank: '10'
  details: The AWS CloudHSM service helps you meet corporate, contractual and regulatory
    compliance requirements for data security by using dedicated Hardware Security
    Module (HSM) appliances within the AWS cloud. With CloudHSM, you control the encryption
    keys and cryptographic operations performed by the HSM.AWS and AWS Marketplace
    partners offer a variety of solutions for protecting sensitive data within the
    AWS platform, but for applications and data subject to rigorous contractual or
    regulatory requirements for managing cryptographic keys, additional protection
    is sometimes necessary. Until now, your only option was to store the sensitive
    data (or the encryption keys protecting the sensitive data) in your on-premises
    datacenters. Unfortunately, this either prevented you from migrating these applications
    to the cloud or significantly slowed their performance. The AWS CloudHSM service
    allows you to protect your encryption keys within HSMs designed and validated
    to government standards for secure key management. You can securely generate,
    store, and manage the cryptographic keys used for data encryption such that they
    are accessible only by you. AWS CloudHSM helps you comply with strict key management
    requirements without sacrificing application performance.The AWS CloudHSM service
    works with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). CloudHSM instances are provisioned
    inside your VPC with an IP address that you specify, providing simple and private
    network connectivity to your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. Placing
    CloudHSM instances near your EC2 instances decreases network latency, which can
    improve application performance. AWS provides dedicated and exclusive (single
    tenant) access to CloudHSM instances, isolated from other AWS customers. Available
    in multiple Regions and Availability Zones (AZs), AWS CloudHSM allows you to add
    secure and durable key storage to your applications.

  details: AWS Step Functions makes it easy to coordinate the components of distributed
    applications and microservices using visual workflows. Building applications from

    are errors, so your application executes in order and as expected. Step Functions
    logs the state of each step, so when things do go wrong, you can diagnose and
    debug problems quickly. You can change and add steps without even writing code,
    so you can easily evolve your application and innovate faster.AWS Step Functions

    Atma Links was designed as a user-friendly alternative to traditional in-text
    advertising. Rather than inserting distracting and, often, irrelevant advertisements
    into text, Atma Links analyzes web content in real-time to identify references
    to online products in plain text. Unambiguous references are automatically converted
    to deep affiliate links to retail sites which sell the product being linked. As
    a supplemental service, Atma also automatically attaches affiliate codes to the
    regular links on a website that are eligible for affiliation. The Atma Links overlay,
    or pop-up, was built to enhance the reading experience by displaying product specific
    information. This product data includes up-to-date pricing info as well as multiple
    search options for the specific product being linked. However, publishers can
    elect to disable this feature and, instead, render the Atma Links presence on
    content site practically invisible. Hover display is one of many customizable
    Atma Links features that empower publishers to control the in-text advertising
    on their websites. With Atma Links, publishers also control the volume, display,
    and relevance of all affiliate links. For product oriented forums, blogs, and
    web applications, Atma Links delivers significant in-text revenue while preserving
    user experience. '

    You do not need to figure out the order for provisioning AWS services or the subtleties
    of making those dependencies work. CloudFormation takes care of this for you.
    After the AWS resources are deployed, you can modify and update them in a controlled
    and predictable way, in effect applying version control to your AWS infrastructure
    the same way you do with your software. You can also visualize your templates
    as diagrams and edit them using a drag-and-drop interface with the?AWS CloudFormation
    Designer.You can deploy and update a template and its associated collection of
    resources (called a stack) by using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line
    Interface, or APIs. CloudFormation is available at no additional charge, and you

- name: AWS CloudHSM

  api_evangelist_rank: '10'
  details: The AWS CloudHSM service helps you meet corporate, contractual and regulatory
    compliance requirements for data security by using dedicated Hardware Security
    Module (HSM) appliances within the AWS cloud. With CloudHSM, you control the encryption
    keys and cryptographic operations performed by the HSM.AWS and AWS Marketplace
    partners offer a variety of solutions for protecting sensitive data within the
    AWS platform, but for applications and data subject to rigorous contractual or
    regulatory requirements for managing cryptographic keys, additional protection
    is sometimes necessary. Until now, your only option was to store the sensitive
    data (or the encryption keys protecting the sensitive data) in your on-premises
    datacenters. Unfortunately, this either prevented you from migrating these applications
    to the cloud or significantly slowed their performance. The AWS CloudHSM service
    allows you to protect your encryption keys within HSMs designed and validated
    to government standards for secure key management. You can securely generate,
    store, and manage the cryptographic keys used for data encryption such that they
    are accessible only by you. AWS CloudHSM helps you comply with strict key management
    requirements without sacrificing application performance.The AWS CloudHSM service
    works with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). CloudHSM instances are provisioned
    inside your VPC with an IP address that you specify, providing simple and private
    network connectivity to your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. Placing
    CloudHSM instances near your EC2 instances decreases network latency, which can
    improve application performance. AWS provides dedicated and exclusive (single
    tenant) access to CloudHSM instances, isolated from other AWS customers. Available
    in multiple Regions and Availability Zones (AZs), AWS CloudHSM allows you to add
    secure and durable key storage to your applications.

  details: When you visit a website, online trackers and the site itself may be able
    to identify you – even if you’ve installed software to protect yourself. It’s
    possible to configure your browser to thwart tracking, but many people don’t know
    how. Panopticlick will analyze how well your browser and add-ons protect you against
    online tracking techniques. We’ll also see if your system is uniquely configured—and
    thus identifiable—even if you are using privacy-protective software.

- name: AWS Snowball
  slug: aws-snowball
  api_evangelist_rank: '10'
  details: Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure appliances
    totransfer large amounts of datainto and out of theAWS cloud. Using Snowball addresses
    common challenges with large-scale data transfers including high network costs,
    long transfer times, and security concerns. Transferring data with Snowball is
    simple, fast, secure, and can be as little as one-fifth the cost of high-speed
    Internet.With Snowball, you don’t need to write any code or purchase any hardware
    to transfer your data. Simply create a job in the AWS Management Console and a
    Snowball appliance will be automatically shipped to you*. Once it arrives, attach
    the appliance to your local network, download and run the Snowball client to establish
    a connection, and then use the client to select the file directories that you
    want to transfer to the appliance. The client will then encrypt and transfer the
    files to the appliance at high speed. Once the transfer is complete and the appliance
    is ready to be returned, the E Ink shipping label will automatically update and
    you can track the job status viaAmazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), text
    messages, or directly in the Console.Snowball uses multiple layers of security
    designed to protect your data including tamper-resistant enclosures, 256-bit encryption,
    and an industry-standard Trusted Platform Module (TPM) designed to ensure both
    security and full chain-of-custody of your data. Once the data transfer job has
    been processed and verified, AWS performs a software erasure of the Snowball appliance.

    environment. In production, youll have an army of users banging away at your app
    and filling your database with data, which puts stress on your code. If youre

    youre never going to build up the volume and variety of data that your app will
    accumulate in a few days in production. Worse, the data you enter will be biased
    towards your own usage patterns and wont match real-world usage, leaving important
    bugs undiscovered.

    learning technologies to synthesize speech that sounds like a human voice. Polly
    includes 47 lifelike voices spread across 24 languages, so you can select the
    ideal voice and build speech-enabled applications that work in many different
    countries.Amazon Polly delivers the consistently fast response times required
    to support real-time, interactive dialog. You can cache and save Polly’s speech
    audio to replay offline or redistribute. And Polly is easy to use. You simply
    send the text you want converted into speech to the Polly API, and Polly immediately
    returns the audio stream to your application so your application can play it directly
    or store it in a standard audio file format, such as MP3.With Polly, you only
    pay for the number of characters you convert to speech, and you can save and replay
    Polly’s generated speech. Polly’s low cost per character converted, and lack of
    restrictions on storage and reuse of voice output, make it a cost-effective way
    to enable Text-to-Speech everywhere.
